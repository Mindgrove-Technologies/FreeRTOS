 * @brief The main function which runs the AES algorithm on H/W
 * @details This function does a couple of things. 
 * 1. It first creates pointers to AES registers.
 * 2. It then does some checks to ensure the data is as per required.
 * 3. It then sets the configuration reg as required - encrypt/decrypt, key length, mode.
 * 4. It then iterates across text blocks and calls the required functions which will run AES. 
 * The H/W takes care of passing one blocks output to the next block 
 * encryption/decryption calculation.
 * 5. It then continually accumulates the outputs.
 * 6. The final step is returning a pointer to an array of output bits.
 * Note that no resetting of configuration is necessary. The AES hardware resets all configs
 * every time the config registration is filled.
 * @param unsigned char *aes_output : pointer to where the aes output has to be stored
 * @param unsigned char *input_text : pointer to the message that has to be encoded
 * @param unsigned char *key : pointer to the key
 * @param unsigned char *iv : pointer to the iv
 * @param long input input_len_bits : length of message in bits
 * @param long int key_len_bits : length of key in bits
 * @param int mode : AES mode. (same as h/w) mode=0 -> ECB, mode=1 -> CBC, mode=2 -> CFB, mode=3 -> OFB, mode=4 -> CTR
 * @param int encrypt_or_decrypt : (same as h/w) =1 -> decrypt, =0 -> encrypt
 * @return Returns nothing. Changes aes_output inplace.

 * 5. It then fills the output in the address pointed to by aes_output (an output address
 * accessible and shared by the user).
 * 6. The final step is returning a pointer to an array of output bits. This helps the user 
 * keep track of how many bits have been encrypted/decrypted. It also helps us differentiate
 * the first block (iterated_length_bits=0) from the other blocks. This helps
 * us set the configurations only once, and let the AES hardware know that the other blocks
 * are a continuation of the same encryption/decryption sequence (Resetting configuration implies
 * new sequence of inputs to AES).
